    let cc44 = "2.Identify Vulnerabilities:"
    let cc45 = "Look for common vulnerabilities such as:"
    let cc46 = "Hardcoded credentials"
    let cc47 = "Sensitive data exposure (e.g., API keys, tokens)"
    let cc48 = "Misconfigured SSL settings"
    
    let cc49 = "5. Advanced Testing Techniques"
    
    let cc50 = "Step 1: Intercepting and Modifying Requests"
    let cc51 = "1.Enable Interception:"
    let cc52 = "Use theIntercept feature to pause and modify requests before they reach the server."
    
    let cc53 = "2.Modify Requests:"
    let cc54 = "Change parameters, headers, or cookies to test how the application responds to manipulated data."
    
    let cc55 = "Step 2: Using Intruder for Automated Attacks"
    let cc56 = "1.Select the Request:"
    let cc57 = "Send requests toIntruder for more extensive testing."
    
    let cc58 = "2.Configure Attack:"
    let cc59 = "Set payloads to test for common vulnerabilities like SQL injection, XSS, or brute-force attacks on login forms."
    
    let cc60 = "6. Reporting Findings"
    
    let cc61 = "1.Generate Reports:"
    let cc62 = "Use Burp Suite’s reporting features to document your findings. Go to Reports >Generate Report to create a detailed report of the vulnerabilities identified."
    
    let cc63 = "2.Prioritize Remediation:"
    let cc64 = "Categorize vulnerabilities based on severity and provide recommendations for fixing them."
    
    let cc65 = "7. Best Practices for Mobile Application Testing"
    let cc66 = "Use Test Accounts: Always use test accounts to avoid affecting real user data during testing."
    let cc67 = "Update Burp Suite Regularly: Keep Burp Suite updated to utilize the latest features and vulnerability checks."
    let cc68 = "Perform Regular Tests: Integrate mobile application testing into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous security checks."
