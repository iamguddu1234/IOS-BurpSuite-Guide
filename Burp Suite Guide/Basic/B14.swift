    let n1 = "Using the Extender for Plugins in Burp Suite"
    let n2 = "The Extender tab in Burp Suite allows you to extend the tool’s functionality by adding custom extensions and plugins. These extensions are either written by users or available from theBApp Store, Burp Suite’s official marketplace for extensions. By using theExtender, you can add new features or automate specific tasks, making Burp Suite even more powerful for security testing."

    let n3 = "Here’s a detailed overview of how to use the Extender for plugins in Burp Suite:"

    let n4 = "1. What is the Extender?"
    let n5 = "The Extender tab provides a way to enhance Burp Suite\'s capabilities by integrating third-party extensions. These extensions can be written in Java, Python (usingJython), or Ruby (usingJRuby). Some popular plugins help automate common security testing tasks, improve productivity, and add custom tools for specific testing needs."

    let n6 = "2. Adding Extensions Using the Extender"
    let n7 = "You can add extensions to Burp Suite either from theBApp Store or by manually loading an extension from a file on your machine."

    let n8 = "2.1 Installing Extensions from BApp Store"

    let n22 = "5.Configure the Extension:"
    let n23 = "Some extensions may require additional configuration. Click on the extension in theExtensions sub-tab and configure any settings required to get it working."

    let n24 = "2.2 Loading Extensions Manually"
    let n25 = "You can also load custom extensions from a file if you have a plugin that isn\'t available in the BApp Store."

    let n26 = "Steps to Load an Extension Manually:"

    let n27 = "1.Open the Extender Tab:"
    let n28 = "Navigate to theExtender tab."

    let n53 = "Functionality: Adds more test cases to Burp\'s scanning capabilities specifically targeting Java Enterprise Edition (J2EE) web applications."
    let n54 = "Usage: Helpful when testing Java-based web applications for vulnerabilities specific to J2EE environments."

    let n55 = "4. Scripting Your Own Extensions"
    let n56 = "If you need specific functionality that’s not covered by existing extensions, you can create your own plugin for Burp Suite. Extensions can be written in Java, Python, or Ruby, making it versatile for developers with different programming backgrounds."

    let n57 = "4.1 Setting Up for Python Extensions"
    let n58 = "To write extensions in Python, you needJython, a Python implementation that works with Java. Here\'s how to set it up:"

    let n59 = "Steps to Set Up Jython:"

    let n60 = "1.Download Jython:"
